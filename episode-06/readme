MONOLITH VS MICROSERVICE

-useEffect hook :
its a callback function. its will call after the component render. when  the body function is render it as soon as render cycle is finished
its called after rendering the components.. useEffect render at the end
-useEffect take two argument one is callback function and other depandency time in array
   useEffect(()=>{},[])
-FETCH: is a browser feature to call the api.
-CORS ORIGIN: browser block the api call if the origin is not same . like call the swiggy/foodpanda api from local its block because of different origin.
we can bypass this cors origin use allow cors extension in chrome .

-shimmer ui: a fake card which load before render actual date. like linkedin etc.
-conditional rendering


why do we need useState? why state variable is different to local/normal variable?
normal variable in react is not able to update/change value in runtime on browser page although when console its show the updated value
but not in rendering. so if you want to render updated one useState came into picture.e:g.
Syntax
const [listResturant,setListResturant]=useState(['KFC']) // second param is the function which is responsible to update the value at rendering time.
you cannot directly update listResturant = 'McDonald' use setsetListResturant('McDonald').
Behind the scene useState re-render the whole component in which its used. like we use in header component so it re-render whole header component.It will compare
with old virtual dom with new DOM so its only change the update variable rest is same as it was. Diff algorithm is responsible to compare new DOM and old.
this process called reconcilation.


Virtual dom is the represtation of JXS. Whenever the local state variable change react render the whole component and compare it will previous DOM to new.
React is very effecient doing dom manipulation.
